# Food Finder 

## Instructions on running

Clone this repo and use android studio (https://developer.android.com/studio) to download an emulator and run the app. You can also find a video demo at the bottom of this readme.


## Description

This app uses the yelp API to find restaurants around you and lists them filtered by price range. You can use the intuitive search system to find food that you are looking for at different locations.

## Acomplishments

- Sucessfully implemented the yelp fusion API which has access to over 50 million businesses.
- Restaurants sorted based on price level in a simple and easily navigable UI.
- An innovative search bar that lets you easily find food all across the globe.

## Challenges

- Loading a huge amount of businesses would make the app run slower and effect performance, therefore limited to a maximum of 50 businesses per search request.
- Implementing a location search feature felt like it would make the UI confusing to navigate, therefore came up with a intuitive single searchbar search system to maintain UI simplicity.
